For compiling tsunami, go through the normal process of:

   ./configure

 From the configure output errors find all those missing packages that you 
 had never even heard of and install them, then try ./configure again.

   make

 That should build the entire tsunami, including everything in
 the subdirectories (in /server, /client, etc).

 And optional 

   sudo make install

 will install the non-realtime binaries ./server/tsunamid 
 and ./client/tsunami onto your system, into /usr/local/...


 Contents of individual subdirectories can be recompiled with
 for example

   cd client
   make clean
   make

 (note that you should first have to compile the entire 
 source tree via ./configure and make, only after that
 recompiling individual subdirectories works without problems)
