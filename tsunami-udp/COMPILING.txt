For compiling tsunami, go through the normal process of:

   ./configure

 From the configure output errors find all those missing packages that you 
 had never even heard of and install them, then try ./configure again.

   make

 That should build the entire tsunami, including everything in
 the subdirectories (in /server, /client, etc).


Contents of individual subdirectories can be recompiled with

   make clean
   make
