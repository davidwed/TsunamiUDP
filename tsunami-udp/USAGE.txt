 Very Quick Guide
 ================

 On the client, start the command line client: 
    ./client/tsunami

 On the server, go to the directory where you
 have the files that should be serverd, and
 start the daemon
    cd /where/my/files/are
    /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/server/tsunamid

 The source code documents the rest ;-))


 Not So Quick Guide
 ==================

 Typical usage example where PC1 is the server and PC2 the client.

 Preparations on PC1:

 pc1$ cd /home/guest/outfiles/
 pc1$ cp /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/server/tsunamid .
 pc1$ ./tsunamid

 Connecting from PC2:

 pc2$ cd /home/guest/infiles/
 pc2$ cp /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/client/tsunami .
 pc2$ ./tsunami
   tsunami> set rate 512M
   rate = 512000000

   tsunami> connect myserver.domain.com
   Connected.

   tsunami> get nameoffile
   00     00      00      368      499     15.59   354.7    0.0       499    0.0   354.7    0.0       0  1      354.7
   ...
   ...

 Help
 ====

 Server application, to get a list of command line options use:
   ./tsunamid --help
 
 Client application, to get a list of options use:
   ./tsunami
   tsunami> help
 And to see the current settings in the client (not persistent
 i.e. not stored between program restarts), use:
   tsunami> set

 Settings in the client can be changed using the "set" command
 which has the format:
   set [option] [value]
