If you have not yet downloaded the source code, you can do so with
an anonymous CVS checkout:

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@tsunami-udp.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/tsunami-udp co -P tsunami-udp

For compiling tsunami, go through the normal process of:

   ./configure

 From the configure output errors find all those missing packages that you 
 had never even heard of and install them, then try ./configure again.

   make

 That should build the entire tsunami, including everything in
 the subdirectories (in /server, /client, etc).

 And optional 

   sudo make install

 will install the tsunami binaries onto the system. 
 The binaries that will be installed are:

   App              Name        From
   Tsunami server   tsunamid    ./server/tsunamid 
   Tsunami client   tsunami     ./client/tsunami
   Realtime server  rttsunamid  ./rtserver/rttsunamid
   Realtime client  rttsunami   ./rtclient/rttsunami

 The binaries will be placed into /usr/local/bin or similar.

 Contents of individual subdirectories can be recompiled with
 for example

   cd client
   make clean
   make

 (Note that you first have to compile the entire 
 source tree via './configure' and 'make'. Only after that you
 can recompile individual subdirectories without problems)
